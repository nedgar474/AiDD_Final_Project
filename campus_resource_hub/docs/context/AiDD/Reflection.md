AI has proven to be a powerful tool for developers. I found that it made creating the site and other projects much faster but did not completely remove the challenges of creating projects of this nature. It proved to be more tedious than expected. The AI made everything happen more quickly than expected but was not immune to making errors or omissions or mistakes or substandard decisions. Coding was begun on this site using Claude Sonnet on VS Code, which proved to be a mistake, creating a half baked project based on misunderstood requirements badly implemented. Many requested features were missed with in both the introductory prompt and the later attempts to fix the website. Claude Sonnet proved to be incapable of dealing with the complexity of the project and had to be replaced with Cursor shortly after beginning. It took too much time and many attempts to track down and fix every error in the sites functionality and to add the requested features and also expand and modify the database to keep up. If I were to start over, I would begin in cursor, place the requirements in the context folder first thing, and begin writing a prompt that would reflect the features and style in the way best suited to the nature of the site. It would probably have been better to use tools like stich or figma to nail down the style before the site got too large and complex to change.

Eventually the site became more stable as development proceeded and cursor was able to add new features and change functionality without causing as many errors. This may have been helped by having the AI generate reports on requirements compliance, style guides,testing logs and development options which likely served as useful context for the AI to draw on in its work.

Late in the project, before demoing with my team, the AI managed to erase the database with all the site data. Luckily, we had just finished updating the seed data to contain images and everything was back up shortly. Based on this experience I will be making manual backups just to be sure this doesn't affect our work again.

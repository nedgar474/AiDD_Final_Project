Usage Guidelines & Notes

Crimson should always remain the dominant color in any communication piece.

Cream/white is used frequently as the neutral/white space baseline; many digital executions prefer white because cream may reproduce poorly.

When selecting a secondary color, choose one and its tints/shades; avoid using multiple secondary colors simultaneously unless clearly justified.

Light grays, neutrals and white are used for backgrounds and large whitespace; and the first section of a page needs to be white with text for accessibility.

FONT 

/* Headings (Serif) */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, serif;
}

/* Body Text (Sans‑serif fallback) */
body {
    font-family: Franklin Gothic, 'Franklin Gothic Medium', Arial, sans-serif;
}
Notes & rationale:

‘Georgia Pro’ is preferred for headings if you have the license. Otherwise fall back to system Georgia (wide availability) and then any serif.

For body or general text, IU doesn’t publicly name one specific sans‑serif ‘web font’ stack; based on substitute guidance we infer Franklin Gothic (or similar) and then generic sans‑serif as fallback.

When embedding custom fonts on web (via @font‑face or web/Google fonts) you must ensure licensing compliance—for example the training page shows how they embed Georgia Pro for web use.

What is the IU Web Framework?
The IU Web Framework is built using Cascade CMS Web Content Management System (WCMS), IU’s enterprise content management system. It gives content creators a set of familiar form options—such as drop-down boxes, text input, checkboxes, and WYSIWYG editors—to create web pages. You can build pages using the framework and then publish them out to Sitehost or any hosting server with FTP. The framework is a self-service tool available to developers.

The IU Web Framework has a rich set of features to create layouts and elements of a web page that were not possible in previous frameworks and templates at IU. It follows a consistent style guide and IU branding guidelines to provide consistency throughout the university’s websites. The framework complies with accessibility guidelines so that visitors with disabilities can still access your site. It is centrally supported by UITS and you can find extensive documentation on this site. This is the first framework to be built using Velocity, which makes it easy to customize as a developer.
